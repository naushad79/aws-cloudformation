# Use of Pseudo Parameters in CloudFormation

In this cloudformation template we are using Pseudo Parameters and I have used AWS::Region, AWS::StackName and AWS::StackId.

There are  others Pseudo Parameters but I have only used 3 of them

## AWS::Region
Returns a string representing the AWS Region in which the encompassing resource is being created

## AWS::StackName
Returns the name of the stack

## AWS::StackId
Returns the ID of the stack

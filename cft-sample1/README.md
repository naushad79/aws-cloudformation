# Creating Multiple AWS Resources

This cloudformation template creates a ec2 instance and a security group, security group will be attached to the ec2 instance and that allows ssh connection to the ec2 instance.

I have also used join Intrinsic Function in this example

Make sure to change the ImageId based on the region, in this example image is selected based on Sydney region.
